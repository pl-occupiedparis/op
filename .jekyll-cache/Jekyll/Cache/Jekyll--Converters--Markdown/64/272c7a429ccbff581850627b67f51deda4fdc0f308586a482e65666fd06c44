<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>The project of this website was created for an undergraduate advanced French history and culture course entitled Paris under the German Occupation and its [Non-] Places of Memory. The French title is a play on the words ¬´ lieu de m√©moire ¬ª (place of memory) and ¬´ un non-lieu ¬ª (a dismissed case). The first questions I was faced with when putting the syllabus together were:  How could students of French, from an American university, understand a past neither of us lived? And  how to expect students ‚Äì some of whom have never been to Paris - to envision the city under the German Occupation without even knowing its space?</p>

<p>After piloting the course and getting students‚Äô input at the end of the semester, the idea to create an interactive map came as a way to address these questions.  The <a href="https://authorial.stanford.edu/">Authorial London Project</a> was a first source of inspiration. Unfortunately, it was a Stanford developed software which was not ready to be shared yet. So with the support of the Penn Libraries and the Price Lab for Digital Humanities, a first map was designed using the plug-in Neatline and hosted on the open-source web-authoring tool Omeka. Later, in the summer of 2021, a Price Lab cohort started the creation of the current website. The bookshelf design,  inspired by the <a href="https://otletsshelf.tumblr.com/">Otlet‚Äôs Shelf</a> Tumblr theme encourages viewers to ‚Äúbrowse the shelves‚Äù and provides a space where the stories of individuals who vanished recovered their voices.</p>

<p>But before going into the story of the creation of the map, let‚Äôs take a detour‚Ä¶</p>

<h2 id="detour">Detour</h2>

<p>The painter Simon Hanta√Ø developed a particular method he called folding (pliage). The word method versus the word technique highlights the fact the painter did not claim full control over the means he employed and did not aim at a definite outcome. His method consisted in folding, creasing, knotting the canvas whose dimensions were usually excessively large.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/the_project/intro_18.jpeg" alt="Peron" class="img-inline" /></p>

<p>He then proceeded to lay the canvas on the floor and painted its visible convex spaces. Being on his knees and bent over his work, Hanta√Ø intentionally denied himself full sight and could not foresee the final result.  This is what he called ‚Äúretinal silence‚Äù. Once the paint was dry, he proceeded to unknot and unfold the cloth.</p>

<p>In the catalogue of a 1976 retrospective, Hanta√Ø shared a picture pointing at the origin of his method. The picture shows his mother wearing a meticulously ironed apron. The symmetrical creases visible on the shiny cloth turn the maternal apron into one of the canvas painted by the son. Therefore, one can say his folding method helped the painter bring back memories to the surface.</p>

<p>The unfolding acted as a revelation. Hanta√Ø talked about chance (hasard) as a key agent in his work for conjuring up what he could not even imagine or think of. Georges Didi-Huberman poetically calls √©toilement the white starring effect left at the intersections and created by the knots. The poet Dominique Fourcade explains that the starring effect represents ‚Äúa sort of lifting, suspension, a prolongation of a time that is not supposed to last.‚Äù</p>

<p>When the canvas is stretched and finds the verticality it was denied while in the making, one can find themselves hear and see its heart beating.</p>

<p><em>‚ÄúI realized what my true subject was ‚Äì the resurgence of the ground underneath my painting.‚Äù</em></p>

<p>Let‚Äôs go to the map‚Ä¶</p>

<h2 id="part-i--mapping-as-method">Part I ‚Äî Mapping as Method</h2>

<p>First, for 5 euros on eBay, I bought a promotional 1940 pocket agenda book with a map of Paris folded inside. It was offered to the customers of the famous department store Les Galeries Lafayette. I liked the idea of a map that had been carried around and manipulated by a stranger instead of a sterile reproduction. Besides, the story of the department store itself is a page ripped out of the history of the German occupation. By the end of 1940, it was aryanized meaning that its Jewish owners and employees were evicted and replaced by non-Jews. The map was unfolded and scanned with the creases time had left in its fabric visible.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/the_project/intro_12.png" alt="Peron" class="img-inline" /></p>

<p>The digital image of the map was then layered onto a digital map of current Paris and the vintage paper map refolded back in its pocketbook. From then on, I followed the same method rooted in unpredictability as Hanta√Ø: bent over the canvas my floor strewn with books, lose sheets, notes, had become, I adopted the dislocated, floating vision of Hanta√Ø. I selected material in accordance with the goals I had for my class specifically which was to make the time period as palpable as possible. I knotted texts together, images and texts together. Instead of brushing paint over this montage as he did, I translated it onto the map using the Neatline platform.  Despite the frontal position I suddenly had facing the screen of my computer, I still proceeded blindly. Mechanically pinning, stitching onto the fabric of the map never knowing what was going to appear in the end and if there was even an end. When I would zoom out, blanks punctuated the map. Yet, surprisingly, they were not obscure blanks, signs of an inevitable erasure.  They stood like semaphores that led me to keep on looking.</p>

<p>About 240 key places were geolocated and identified with a description of the place before the war, during the war, and after the war. The places were first selected following C√©cile Desprairies‚Äôs invaluable guide Paris dans la Collaboration which is organized by arrondissement. Almost each pin comes with a picture and with excerpts</p>
<ul>
  <li>from selected memoirs written by key actors who survived and were published after the war e.g. the prefect of Paris Roger Langeron, the journalist Pierre Audiat, the lawyer Maurice Gar√ßon, the novelist Jean Gu√©henno , the historian Georges Wellers, the German artist Arno Breker</li>
  <li>from the texts written by 2 young key witnesses who did not survive the war: H√©l√®ne Berr, Louise Jacobson</li>
  <li>from the writings of young witnesses later turned writers: Sarah Kofman, Marcel Cohen, Patrick Modiano, Georges Perec</li>
</ul>

<p>The map‚Äôs significance lies in the spatial visualization of history it provides and which contributes to reducing the historical and psychological distance that separates us from then and them. We can take the example of the V√©lodrome d‚ÄôHiver where 13,000 Jews were locked in after being rounded up on July 16th, 1942 and before being sent to concentration camps.The velodrome was an indoor stadium famous for its bicycle races. In the mid 30s, it hosted many political conventions led by the future Socialist prime minister, L√©on Blum, a Jewish man.  The July 1942 round-up is known today by the name Vel d‚ÄôHiv round-up. Being able to see where the V√©l d‚ÄôHiv stood ‚Äì it does not exist anymore -  first makes us realize how shockingly close it was from the Eiffel Tower (in fact, it was a short 10 minute walk). We can also read from the map that it stood amid the liminal space connecting the industrial neighborhoods in the south ‚Äì best represented by the Citroen car factory where Taylorism was first experimented in France -  and the area developed through the various world fairs Paris hosted. One of the characteristics of those fairs was to build places programmed to be erased from the map almost immediately afterwards and replaced soon after.</p>

      <td>Clicking on the Velodrome pin on the map gives access to pages from period newspapers which in turn give the reader closer access to the fabric</td>
      <td>fabrications of the time. In  fact, in the newspaper from October 1941, three sections are referring to the V√©lodrome : N√©laton and Grenelle which are the names of the 2 streets the velodrome was located at and then under the title ‚ÄúLa Nuit des Etoiles‚Äù (The night of the stars) which fortunately does not refer to the yellow stars that were to be worn the following May.</td>

      <header>Muller Family</header>
      <p>The Muller family lived at 3 rue de l'Avenir in the 20th arrondissement. Manek and Rachel emigrated from Poland in the 1930s and set up shop as home-based dressmakers. During the war, their four children - Henri, Jean, Annette and Michel - attended school on rue Olivier-Metra.</p>
      <p>On July 16, 1942, French police officers came to arrest Rachel and the children. Manek, warned of an imminent round-up and convinced that it would only concern men, hid the day before with a neighbor. The two eldest sons, Henri and Jean, managed to escape and were reunited with their father. Annette, Michel and their mother were taken to the Vélodrome d'Hiver where they stayed for several days before being taken to the Pithiviers camp. On August 7, 1942, Rachel was deported from Pithiviers on convoy #16 and arrived at Auschwitz on August 9. Only Manek and the children survived. </p>
      <p>In 1991, Annette published <i>La Petite Fille du Vel d'Hiv</i>, which she dedicated to her mother, Rachel. In his preface, Serge Klarsfeld says that "Annette has become the family memorialist. Annette's account is movingly intense, so much so that her love for her mother dominated her life as a child; a cheerful, beautiful, intelligent, hard-working, flirtatious and sociable mother." On the day of the roundup, the mother begs: "Don't take the children".</p>
      <p>Annette died on August 9, 2021. 79 years to the day after her mother disappeared in Auschwitz.</p>

      <h3>Testimony from Annette Bessmann née Muller</h3>
      <p>Annette Muller was arrested during the July 16, 1942 round-up. She experienced the horror of the Vel' d'Hiv', was torn away from her mother who was forced onto a train bound for Auschwitz, and lived through the hell of Drancy. Post-war France did not want to talk about this horror. Shocked by the silence surrounding what is now called the Vel' d'Hiv' roundup and especially the amnesia that covered the fate of Jewish children in France during the Second World War, Annette decided to write the story of her childhood in 1976. She sent her text to numerous publishing houses. In vain. It was not until 1983 that Serge Klarsfeld published fragments of it in his book Vichy-Auschwitz. The Barbie trial and the film Au revoir les enfants by Louis Malle in 1987 opened the eyes of the public. Annette's testimony finally found an audience. In 1991, the first edition of La petite fille du Vel' d'Hiv' was published by Denoël. The book tells the story of her family from 1929 to the autumn of 1942 when she was released from Drancy. In 2009, she published the completed version with a recounting going all the way to 1947 and followed by the testimony of her father Manek. Although they have been essential reference texts for researchers, writers, and filmmakers, none of Annette's works has ever been translated into English. The following work is a humble contribution to filling this gap. We hope that reading it will inspire a professional translator to do an official translation of La petite fille du Vel' d'Hiv'.</p>
      <p>In 1995, Annette and her three brothers, Henri, Jean and Michel, provided testimonials to the USC Shoah Foundation. The text below is a translation of Annette's testimony, interspersed with excerpts from her brothers'. This four-voice account attempts to reconstruct, as closely as possible, the childhood of these survivors as they depicted it 50 years after the events. It also tries to reproduce the indefectible complicity that bonded "this clan" until the end. Unfortunately, it does not answer all the questions that readers may have. Only La petite fille du Vel' d'Hiv' provides all the keys.</p>

              <p class="carousel-item__description">Henri Muller has kept many letters and cards exchanged between brothers and sisters during the war but also between Manek and his children. This epistolary correspondence highlights the love that bound the Muller family. Despite the risks involved, the father never stopped writing to his children and making sure they had everything they needed. Reading Manek's letters also tells the story of an immigrant who had not yet mastered the French language and had to hide. In his handwritten letters, we hear the melody of his accent that emerges from his phonetic writing. In the ones written for him by his childhood friend, Marc Kleinman, who spoke French perfectly and with whom Manek was hiding in Périgueux, the accent disappears behind a text displaying precise grammar and spelling. There are also letters with approximate spelling written by French people, such as the concierge of the Place du Guignier. To read these texts is to unwind the intimate thread that linked the family despite the separation. But it is also to discover the story of an immigrant through his linguistic peregrinations. The man who was called Manek Schneps in his native country became Manek Muller in his adopted country. Although his letters are signed Muller, it is Schneps who expresses himself through a language that often escapes him and who, in spite of everything, succeeds in expressing all his love to his children.</p>

I was obliged to leave Paris for some time and will not be able to see you any time soon. I am very sorry about this. I beg you very much to write me very regularly a card once a week to the address of Marc Kleinman 81, rue de Bordeaux - Périgueux. I will think of you all the time but don't forget me either. I hope we can meet again soon. If you need something for a dessert write to the house Evain 156, rue Pelleport Paris 20th who will send you what you want. Everything is paid in advance. I have not yet heard from Mom. Don't forget my little Henri to take care of Jean. Once again I ask you to write to me once a week. I give you both a big kiss. 
Your father Muller

I received your card and was very happy with it. It was clean, well written and without spelling mistakes. I hope that you will continue like this. You have started to go to school again. You will have to work hard to do regularly all your homework and above all to be clean and be very good. Continue to write to me every week. Reading your cards is my only pleasure. I have sent you a small package and will send you another one soon. I hope, my dear children, to have soon news from Michel and Anette (sic). Your dad, who is thinking of you, kisses you both very much.

My dear little ones. 
Your card gave me great pleasure. I am happy to know that you are in good health and hope that you do not lack anything. I recommend to you again to do well at school, to do regularly your lessons and homework. You will give me thus a lot of joy, because you are now my only consolation. I wrote to you in the previous card, that in addition to Mrs. Schindler's packages, I sent you a package from here; did you receive it? If you are too busy during the whole week, write to me all Thursday, that's the day you are most free? Your father who thinks of you often, sends you both a big kiss

My dear children 
I would like to announce to you first of all a very good news. I have just received a card from Annette; she is with Michel in Paris. I ask you to write to them immediately to the following address: Annette Muller - 27, rue du Chevalier de la Barre Paris 18. They will be very happy to have of your news. I am very sorry to know that you don't have any shoes. I try to find some here, but it is very difficult. If it rains too much one day it's better not to go to school that day than to catch cold. Write to Sister Clotilde a very polite card asking her to find some shoes. Do you have money, my little ones, to buy cards and for your little expenses? Your father who thinks of you sends you a big kiss

My dear little ones.
I have just sent you the third package - I hope you have received the two previous ones - write to me as soon as you receive it. Have you written to Annette and has she answered you? Write to her often and send her a pencil and some cards. She thus will be able to write to who she wants. I also sent today a parcel to Annette and Michel, I was planning to send them cards, but I forgot. Please write to Sister Clotilde to ask her if she wants to do something to bring all four of you together. As for Mom, I hope that we will find her and will be together again one day. I send you kisses.

I have just received your card. It made me happy but a little surprised at the same time. I seemed to read in your card that you are sad but you don't dare to admit it to me. How I understand you my little ones. You have to be brave and have patience. You must understand that if I could, I would come to see you every day. I am also very sad that I am not able to do so. Something else worries me my little ones. When I left, I left 3000 frs. to pay your room and board. I didn't know how much it was necessary to pay per month. I ask you to ask for how many months I owe and how much money I owe. I will send it as soon as possible. I have also sent you each 100 frs to buy the little things, which you may need. I kiss you both.

I have just received your letter which gave me great pleasure. I would like to know how Jean's ear is doing? I had sent you 200 francs for your expenses. I hope that you will soon be together with Michel and Annette, so Henri take good care of your brothers and your sister. I had sent you a package. If you see Annette ask if mom has left for her some things , also dear Henri asks sister Clotilde if Annette will be with you. And now write to me if you have had shoes, if you are eating well and if you are sharing your parcel well. From Mom I have no news, but let's hope to hear from her soon and I will do my best to go and see you. Write me a little more than usual. I am finishing my card hoping that it finds you in good health. I give you a big kiss your father who thinks of you.

 I have received your card, which naturally gave me great pleasure, because you are now together all four of you. Dear Henri, I would like to know what Annette has told you about your dear mother, and whether she entrusted her with any things and what she said, if Michel and Annette look well and are not too tired. Did you receive the third package I sent you? and did Annette receive the two packages and the 50 Fr? I would also like to know if you have warm clothes and shoes - Are you all in good health? and do you share the parcels among yourselves? I am still without news from mom, but hopefully it will come. I kiss you very much all four - Your father who thinks of you.

I received your last card and read it with the same pleasure as the previous ones. I am very happy that you can see each other quite regularly with Annette and Michel while waiting for us to see each other with your mother. Did Annette receive the last package in which I had sent her some clothes? I will make very soon a package to send to you and that you asked me for, as well as some clothes. It is extremely difficult to find something but I am doing my best and hope to succeed. My little ones you must take good care of your things as you probably know it is very difficult to replace them. Ask Mr. Schindler if it is possible for him to make you each a pair of pants. I always work in the same place. I give you a big kiss all

I have left you for too long without writing to you and I blame myself enough. Believe me, I cannot write to you very often, but that should not prevent you from writing to me regularly. I have already written to you that your cards are my only pleasure. I received a card from Annette and Michel which made me very happy. Do you see them often? Did you receive the package of clothes and do they fit you well? My little Jean, is your ear completely healed? You have not talked to me about it for some time. I hope that we will soon have news from Mom and that we will all meet again soon. Did you have a Merry Christmas. I wish you a happy year and give you a big kiss.

My dear Jean, 
Were you able to spend Christmas with Michel and Annette? I hope you received my Christmas parcel - please tell me what you receive and if there is nothing missing. I sent some shoes but they are a bit big: I think they will fit anyway. Does Jean still have an earache? I wish it would go away. I am well and still working here. Please write to me if you have received the package of clothes. I send you a big kiss. Your father who thinks of you and who loves you.

 I have just received your cards which gave me great pleasure. I am happy to hear that you have been reunited again and have been able to spend some time together again. I am also glad that the christening and the whole ceremony made you so happy. I hear with pride that you are working well and hope that you will continue. Continue to pray for peace in the near future we all need it. Did you receive the last package? I beg you to let me know immediately at reception, because if they should be lost it would be a pity that I continue to send them. Your father who loves you well kisses you all My little Jean - are you no longer suffering from your ears?

I have received your letter as well as the picture which gave me great pleasure. I learn with joy that I will soon receive your photos I am looking forward to them. I am happy to know that you are in good health and happy to have taken your communion. I hope that you finished your school year well; now you will have more leisure time and you will be able to write to me more often. Let me know if you are eating well and if you are receiving all the packages, let me know also if you need something special and I will try to send it to you. How did you find Annette and Michel during your last meeting? Tell me what the doctor said about Jean's ears? I asked you several times and you never answered the questions I ask you. How do you spend your free time; write often to Annette and Michel My little Jean, do you have enough cotton for your care? Thank the sisters for all the kindness they have for you and be grateful for the home they have recreated for you. Continue to pray for soon Mom's safe return.Let's hope that it will not be long before we all see each other again soon. Your father who is always thinking of you kisses you tenderly – 
Mr. Muller

I am parti- cularly happy that you no longer suffer from you ear and that your boo-boo will soon be completely healed. It is very pleasant for me to read your letters and to see how reasonable you are. I am particularly touched to see that you do not forget to ask in every letter information about my work and my life away from you. On the other hand, it is very painful for me not to be able to visit you for the moment. You must be patient, my dear children, do not despair - even though your misfortune and our sorrows are very great - we must remember that there are people even more unfortunate than us. Courage soon we will all get together with Mom I am still working at the same place and manage to get by. don't worry about me, you see that I always manage to send you a package from time to time.I have received the photo of your communion - here you are now big boys. Annette regularly writes me beautiful letters, she is happy and works well. Michel is [?] so write often to Annette so that she doesn't get bored. I beg you to thank the dear Sisters for their devotion to you and in particular the Sister who kindly wrote me a few words. Did you receive the last package with the apples. I end my letter kissing you very tenderly. Your father who always thinks of you

I received your card and I was very happy. I am particularly happy to know that you are in good health and free of tuberculosis. I have heard from Annette and Michel, I hope they write to you as well. They are both very happy. Sister Clotilde sent me a long letter to me and I answered her recently. I asked her to place you Henri in middle school in the hope that you will do well there and also asked her not to separate you if it is possible. She must certainly have informed you of her intentions and will let you know in due course her decisions. I ask you to trust her completely, as she always acts in your best interest. In your next reply, please write me how you spend your time and whether you eat well. I know that the difficulties of supply are quite great, so I will do my best to send you, from time to time parcels. Be sure that despite the difficulties in which I find myself, I am thinking of you above all. My little Jean, are you still continuing your ear treatments? I still firmly believe that we will soon be reunited and even though our separation is still prolonged I do not lose hope. Your father who always thinks of you kisses you tenderly.

 I think that both of you are well and that Jean is happy to be with Michel, you make a good couple. I come to announce to you that on Holy Thursday, I will have the happiness to take My Private Communion. I think that you will pray well for me so that I will be ready to accomplish this great act; I will not forget you, neither dad, nor mom. Maybe dad will be present at my Communion; judge if I would be happy. My uncle Pierre wrote to me, he asks me for your address, I will give it to him. I am doing very well because we are very well fed and we have large portions. Now that the snow is gone, we will go for long walks in the mountains. Already on Sunday we were able to go out. Genevieve's father is going to come, we are happy because he is going to bring us news about My Mother and many things that My Sister Marie has asked for. My Mother wrote to us Marguerite Vachon and me a beautiful short letter that we have kept preciously so we can read it again from time to time. I say hello to My Sister Thérèse, to My Sister Anne-Marie and to Mademoiselle Olympe, and to both of you I give you a big kiss. Your little sister who always thinks of you. Annette Muller 
 
As my letter was leaving I receive yours, I thank you for having thought of my birthday and to Mademoiselle Olympe, and I kiss both of you very much. Your little sister who always thinks of you.

I have received your letter which gave me great pleasure. As I promised you I am sending you a pair of shoes in case the shoes would be too big, you must ask Sister Marie to try to exchange them for a smaller size. A few days ago I sent you a package you will receive at the same time a package from a lady; for all this you must not write to me until I write you a new address. I hope that you have written a letter to your brothers because I have not received anything and now with the change of my residence I will remain without news, that's why you must write often to your brothers So my dear Annette, as always try to be nice and please all the women who take care of you. I will try to send a package to Henri again before I leave, then you can ask him if he has received it. I'm ending my letter with a big kiss for you your dad who is always thinking of you

              <p class="carousel-item__description">Dear Jean. Dear Michel. 
Foreword I will give you some news from Neuilly that will please you. I received your letter the other day, you told me what you had for Christmas, I too have been spoiled by Madame Valentin. On January 2, 1945 I went to see S. Clotilde with Annette. As it was too early, I went up to the Bon Marcher [sic] with Annette. She gave a chwg gum for each of you, that is one for you and one for Michel - Papa comes to see me quite often and he would like all the boys to come back - You know Jean, excuse me for my handwriting, but my finger hurts (an abscess) you know I have all the misfortunes. I had a stye in my eye again. At the moment there is snow, snow, snow... But today it's the top. 15cm of snow we can't walk, fortunately it's Thursday, so we stay in the big hall. 
1st stage. So now let's talk about Superior School. I started school on January 3rd. Very well received by my friends, we are 15 in our class - For arithmetic: it's algebra at its maximum (x + y - z + x) fortunately I studied some with the abbot [?] Spelling : it is the director as last year - Geo: the world - Ancient History - Chemistry - Physics - Literature - Metric System English angles - it's okay. Pause for an anecdote. There is a little 5 year-old. So the other 3 had him clean the toilets with snow so he was frozen. He was screaming: "It's burning!" What a life... I send you a can of paint. You will say thank you to me meaning you will write to me Did you get the knives- Brian came. Lemoine too and Mon [?] too. We had the visit of Miss Rolland and Mr. Desprez. Rolland will come back tomorrow. Well I have nothing more to tell you. I send you a big kiss as well as Michel 
Your big brother Henri Muller

The vacations have started and we are having a great time. We are playing soldiers, and all kinds of games. I hope that you are very well and that Pierre is well too. I will give you the address for the ceremony that will take place on Sunday April 1st, it is this Sunday coming. Here is the address 30 rue Saint Hilaire La Varenne ((Seine et Oise)) You will need to take the train at 10:55 from the Bastille I hope you will go with Pierre and Annette. For the children Annette will be able to eat with us, but for the adults you have to ask to the Comite 36 rue Hamelot [sic]. Goodbye my dear dad Jean goes to 36 rue Hamelot [sic] on Thursday he will take the train at 9:22 am. So he will arrive in Paris like the other time around 9:50-10 I send you a big kiss 
Henri Muller.

              <p class="carousel-item__description">My dear Henri. 
Thank you very much for your letters, they have made me both very happy and a bit of displeased. Somewhat displeased especially, because you lose faith in me so fast. That I didn't sent you your things right away, that I know, I'm wrong, very wrong even, but I'll explain to you later why I didn't send it to you. But that you doubt that I've already spent the money you gave me, so my dear Henri, that is not right. But who do you think I am? As for the package you told me to send you listen carefully to what I'm going to tell you about it. The day I arrived, I couldn't do anything, it was the evening, you understand me, don't you. So, the next day it already started to bear on my mind - so I go to Marc's room and ask him for your things, you see that despite everything I wanted to keep my promises, so deep down, I'm not quite sure what you think I am. But let's get back to the point. So, Marc gives me your stuff, a huge box, when I saw that, it already started to intimidate me. I am not resourceful at all. You know that. He took the box to the bathroom of our room. It's still there now. I thanked him, and he left. Well, here I am with the box in my hands. Ah! that box, for God's sake! I will remember it for a long time. It will have given me a lot of trouble, I assure you. I'm curious, you know, like all women. No sooner did I get it I opened it, and sure enough, I saw things that I liked, and that could very well serve me for the the seventh grade. First of all the book on the Metric System, that's the one I need, so I took it. The other books Lotte took them, not all of them because she saw that some of them belonged to you. In your next letter you will tell me exactly what is yours or not, because that's what's bothering me the most. I took the little Larousse English-French dictionary if you use it, I will send it back to you. Are you using the compass box if not, couldn't you lend it to me. You know Henry I need a pen, very, very badly, couldn't you send me one with the plaid coat? Please. You wouldn't have thought I'd be in the seventh grade, did you? Neither did I.
as a matter of fact, we've already done 6 compositions, I only have one grade in French, the essay, you know! you understand, I got 13 out of 20, I'm third out of 28. Then we did a composition too, I got eight and a half out of 10. Jean wrote to me, but I don't remember his address. Would you please send it to me, and you will be an angel. Is Michel still in Paris? Have you heard about the exhibition of children's work in Paris. It was Méhoncourt that won. We have a beautiful study room now, it's the old office. The new office is in the old room of Mrs. Herman, who has left. Jacquie and Bernard are getting married today, and are leaving in the evening for Montpelier. Buart will write to you, Albert Grabert told me, and even Albert says hi, as well as Marc, Lotte, every one in fact. Bernard's little ones always ask when you'll be back. I give Dad a big kiss, you tell him that I'm doing well, that I'm going to see him at Christmas, and that I kiss everyone and Pierrot of course. Hello to Rachel and her family. Don't forget the coat and the pen (if you can) don't do like me. your sister (I don't even know how to write sister now.) your sister. Love to you. Annettett (but I am crazy)

And the moment that I have just finished the first letter they bring me your letter dated Monday 24. I am very happy. Don't be sorry, Annette is not sick. It was a cold. Annette has everything she needs clothes-wise long pants, shoes, coat. So don't worry about her. I was given a raincoat and good shoes and I'm going to get a coat. I was also given a suit with two pairs of long pants. You see, I am well dressed. So you see, everything is fine with me. Come quickly on New Year's Day . Dad, I'll send you as soon as possible 5 soldering sticks with a small box of [?]. I've already spotted some in Le Mans. It's very easy to find. The market is every Friday. So I will go... I kiss you very much. 
Henri Muller 

My dear dad, you must not believe that I am sick, yes I have cold but it's over. I am waiting for you with impatience.
 Annette Your little daughter who loves you very much. Good kisses
